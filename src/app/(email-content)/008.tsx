                    Hola amigos, I&apos;m back with another whirl of whimsy. I
                    slacked, but we&apos;re simply so back. My brother and my
                    bestest friend both left Calgary for new adventures
                    recently, so I&apos;ve been a bit sad. The good kind of sad
                    though.{' '}
                    <Em>&quot;What is grief, if not evidence of love?&quot;</Em>{' '}
                    and whatnot. Needless to say, I&apos;ve been especially
                    somber as of late. Let&apos;s explore my psyche together,
                    shall we?

                    I&apos;m in a weird situationship with my desire. On one

                    other, it refuses to articulate itself and contradictions
                    stack up quickly when it does.{' '}

                        I don&apos;t really know why I want so many

                    I&apos;ve recently been thinking of &quot;wanting&quot; as a
                    skill to be practiced. And I worry that I&apos;ve let that
                    muscle atrophy a little. Wanting things, properly, is
                    difficult & vulnerable for me. It exposes who I am and I
                    struggle with some resistance to that. I&apos;m not entirely
                    sure how to train this muscle, but I think it&apos;s a
                    worthwhile pursuit.

                    Do we live in a digital surveillance state? Between the
                    permanence of recorded media, the rise of cringe culture, &
                    performative <Em>everything</Em>, I feel as though I&apos;m
                    being watched even when I&apos;m not. I mentioned this idea
                    to my friend <Em>D</Em> & she noted that people seem much
                    more easily embarrassed than they used to be. Candidly, this
                    feels true for me too.

                    I don&apos;t even have much more to comment. I perceive a
                    strangely persistent observation of my actions, and anything
                    remotely interesting about my life requires overcoming it. I
                    suppose this is me announcing a new side quest for myself.

                    is a book I read recently. It&apos;s an interesting
                    framework for personality, and I feel as though I learned to
                    have more grace after reading it.

                    is a video about <Em>Magic: The Gathering</Em> that is
                    secretly just game design theory. In general this podcast
                    analyzes <Em>Magic</Em> through the lens of broader game
                    design and if that&apos;s your kind of nerd then I would
                    highly recommend.

                    is an essay about estrangement and the differing
                    perspectives of estranged parents and estranged children.
                    It&apos;s a little hopeless in its tone, so I struggle to
                    fully resonate with it, but I think it&apos;s an interesting
                    topic explored well here.
