Before that though, here&#x27;s the tldr on my life. Online dating is a strange experience for me, a new side project has captivated my attention (please ask, I&#x27;m dying to yap), and I am quickly becoming a D1 Substack glazer. With that aside, let&#x27;s get into our main dishes.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:24px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">Start an inspiration folder, it&#x27;s great</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">I have rediscovered the joys of keeping an inspiration folder. Aren&#x27;t they delightful? Portals to manifestations of my imagination. Tapestries of projects yet to be. They spark such joy in their simplicity - breadcrumbs of an epiphany waiting to happen. I now keep track of sentences that resonate, art that speaks, products that delight. And it works! No matter how lost I am at the beginning of a project, some scrolls through my various inspiration folders always get me back on track. I would highly highly highly recommend it.</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">If you have a folder like this, I would love to see it btw.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:24px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">What one does with a blank cheque</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">What <i>would</i> I do with a blank cheque? The answer feels obvious (yes please infinite money?), and yet I&#x27;ve been contending with what my answer (or my lack of one) might imply about my motivations, my journey, and my path.</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">Initially I connected the clarity around what one would do with a blank cheque to their clarity around their goals (financially). Someone who wants to be financially independent and has done the calculations to know how much that would cost and where that capital would need to be deployed would likely know almost the exact number they would write on that cheque, right? This sort of person would likely already have considered how this influx of wealth might change their lifestyle, views, and relationships. They would be prepared for it, even.</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">When generalized, the &quot;blank cheque&quot; hypothetical refers to when an opportunity with high potential returns can only be effectively leveraged through deliberate action. Growing up, my dad always said that luck was just a combination of preparation and opportunity, and I think the idea of &quot;blank cheques&quot; resonates with that perspective. I am reminded of mentors who offered to teach me, old acquaintances who offered to grow closer me, and projects that offered to enrich and engage me. All &quot;blank cheques&quot; in their own way, all cashed out with mixed success. I&#x27;ve started paying more attention to these occurrences in my life. I find that my directional clarity guides the quality of my execution and I take people up more on their offers when I know what I want. I want to live a life where no blank cheque is wasted.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:24px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">Hey these were interesting</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151"><a href="https://www.shrump.cam/" target="_blank" style="color:#F4F1ED;text-decoration:none"><span style="padding:4px 8px;background-color:#050505;border-radius:8px"><span>&#127760;</span> shrump.cam</span></a> <!-- -->is massively ridiculous and exactly what software makers should be getting up to more often.
