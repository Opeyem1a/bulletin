For the anime nerds, I view this somewhat like nen types from Hunter X Hunter. People <span style="color:#374151;opacity:0.8"><i>can</i></span> learn skills outside of their natural skillset, but it&#x27;s less efficient to do so. The further from their natural skillset, the slower their pace of learning or the worse the quality of their output.

I think a lot about what I believe mine to be and I wonder if others know theirs too.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:16px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">Why do I self-impose surveillance?</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">I notice myself choosing to invite judgement into my private thoughts frequently. Recently I made something. A proof of concept for a motion design effect I figured out. For whatever reason, I decided to shop the prototype around to friends for &quot;feedback&quot; before I continued &quot;polishing it&quot;. In reality, it was my first attempt at even trying to make something with motion in an embarrassingly long time. Instead of just letting myself call that a prototype and using that momentum to continue iterating, I pushed my network to critique it until the list of notes for improvement choked any motivation I had to continue.</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">Reflecting on this, I realize I do this a lot. And it&#x27;s entirely unnecessary. Every time I open the comments to see which opinions I&#x27;m allowed to have or phrase my thoughts as a question instead of a statement, I wittle away my individuality and agency. This has become a focused area of improvement for me in my personal and professional lives.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:16px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">AI is a weird conundrum</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">On one hand, LLM technology is incredibly cool and useful. On the other hand, there&#x27;s a growing moral debate around its usage and the largely unethical way it was created in the first place. As a Guy in Tech<span>&#8482;</span>, I find myself torn. I want to push the frontier and figure out how to best integrate new technology in a way that paves a sustainable path, but I also worry that I use this an excuse to avoid taking any accountability for my usage of these sorts of tools. I think I am generally on the side that if people are going to be making decisions on this sort of technology, I&#x27;d rather be in the room than not, but I&#x27;m curious to understand more sides to this issue as I move forward.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:16px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">Hey these were interesting</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO-m3yGjiBp/" target="_blank" style="color:#F4F1ED;text-decoration:none"><span style="padding:4px 8px;background-color:#2D81FF;border-radius:8px"><span>&#127916;</span> [Defining a value]</span></a> <!-- -->is a short video about values.
