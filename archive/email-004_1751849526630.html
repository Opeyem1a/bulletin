                                            joy. Also, a few people have

                                            that the experience of being taught
                                            is quite community-building. As in
                                            the process of not knowing
                                            something, acknowledging that,
                                            requesting knowledge from others,
                                            and then receiving that knowledge
                                            has been a bonding experience in my
                                            life.

                                            We have seemingly infinite access to

                                            but I worry that overusing it robs

                                            can easily Google why wisdom teeth
                                            need to get removed, for example,
                                            but why not ask my community? Why
                                            not reconnect with old acquaintances
                                            who would leap at the opportunity to
                                            chat about their area of expertise?
                                            We can always validate community
                                            answers with the internet later, but
                                            if we scratch the curiousity itch
                                            immediately, then we&#x27;ll never
                                            turn to our communities at all.
