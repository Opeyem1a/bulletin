Someone once told me that inspiration is perishable, and watching people just refuse to let their inspiration go unaddressed triggers a deep motivation in me. It&#x27;s inspiring to see someone with the patience and tenacity required to take a vision to the finish line. I find that the average person in general just doesn&#x27;t particularly try. They work, yes, but working and trying feel like different concepts to me. Working is what one does, measured in effort spent. Trying, to me, is directed effort, measured in velocity. Trying is tediously choosing to take an active role in one&#x27;s life; to be in the driver&#x27;s seat; to play life in first-player mode. I aspire to try.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="height:16px"></td></tr><tr><td><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#185B6A">What I choose to make things mean?</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">I scratched up my car recently. A real chipped paint and dented door combo. Big yikes, I know. It wasn&#x27;t even a cool story, I just took too tight of a corner around too concrete of a pillar in too small of a parkade. My first response here was a <span>&#128556;</span>. So while I was letting that simmer for a few minutes at low heat, I remembered a video I watched some time ago.</p><p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151">The video&#x27;s main premise was about being very intentional about the conclusions one draw from information. The video called this &quot;what we choose to make things mean&quot;. <span style="color:#374151;opacity:0.8"><i>Apophenia</i></span> is the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern between unrelated or random things, and it&#x27;s a phenomenon I&#x27;m personally quite prone to. My impulse in that parkade after scratching my car was &quot;I&#x27;m a bad driver&quot;, and perhaps I am, but why should my experience lead to this result? Literally speaking, I made a poor choice in a brief moment that resulted in no damage to anyone but myself. To assign any more meaning to it than that would demand justification.<!-- --> </p><span style="font-size:12px;line-height:1.65;color:#374151;opacity:0.8"><i>This message is sponsored by Opey&#x27; Auto Body Repairs.
